# The-Bookstore-Project
This project was created to simulate what happens inside a bookstore

The Bookstore project was created to help manage a bookstore, from creating and maintaing the inventory of books, cds, and dvds to selling them to customers. My bookstore has three different functionalities
that allow the bookstore to execute properly and without any mistakes. The bookstore has three main functionalites; creating memberships for regular customers at the bookstore,
adding new or existing inventory, and checking out items from the bookstore.
